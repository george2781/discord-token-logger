# NO LONGER WORKING AS OF 25-6-22 (DD-MM-YY)
# Project information
None of the token loggers I found on the internet worked properly, so I modified one
# How to use
Take the python file, add your webhook url where specified and use it how you like.
# Compiling it?
There are multiple ways to compile a python file, such as py2exe or just compiling it raw however I can't recommend on how you do so because I am in fact, not you.
# Other general information
I accept no responsibility for what you do with this (more info in the LICENSE file).
The program needs any varient of python 3, python 3.9.x will do.
The program is designed to check for tokens in several locations (examples include discord, discord ptb, discord canary and chrome).
